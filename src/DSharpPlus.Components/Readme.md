This library provides a simple component system for DSharpPlus, inspired by Discord.Net's Interaction implementation.

## Features
- Declare handlers for Buttons, Modals and most components using attributes similar to how you can declare commands.
- Automatic registration of component handlers.
- Handlers can take parameters from the component's custom ID using wildcards.
